summary: |
Cloud Administrators face challenges in managing HMAC keys within their organizations, 
lacking visibility into which user accounts have generated these keys and whether they are 
actively being used to access storage objects. Additionally, there's a lack of functionality 
to revoke keys associated with other users, restricting their ability to enforce security 
policies effectively.
Incident response teams rely on Cloud Logging to monitor Cloud Storage object access, but 
they lack specific indicators to determine if HMAC keys are being utilized in these access attempts. 
While various containment actions, such as suspending or deleting compromised user accounts, 
may initially seem effective by rejecting previously created Sigv4 signed headers, reactivating 
or recreating the same user allows the reuse of credentials unless they have expired.

Furthermore, removing Cloud IAM Roles can revoke access to affected storage resources. However, 
it's important to note that reassigning roles does not invalidate previously created Sigv4 signed headers, 
allowing them to continue functioning even after the role change.
