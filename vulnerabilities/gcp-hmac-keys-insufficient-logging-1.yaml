summary: |
Cloud Audit Logs do not capture actions mediated through the cloud console private API 
service (cloudconsole-pa). Consequently, there is no logging of HMAC key creation or deletion 
linked to user accounts. This absence of logs hampers defenders' ability to alert or monitor 
the creation of HMAC keys for user accounts, posing a persistence risk, or their deletion, 
presenting a denial of service risk.
